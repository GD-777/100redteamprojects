### Port Scanner using Python

Port scanning is a very important step in Reconnaissance. There are lot of great tools for port scanning in the market. But, they aren't flexible to be implemented in one's own code (or I'm not aware, maybe).     
Anyways, building a tool from scratch lets us learn a lot of things.

**Project 11, project 12 and project 13** are integrated into this project. This tool uses ICMP packet to detect TTL of the packet sent by the target.
