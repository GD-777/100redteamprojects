Unlike the previous projects, you don't have to wait until the other lets you talk. You can make some noise whenever you want to, bruh!

These files support full duplex communication where both can send messages and receive messages simultaneously.
This project requires you to install some additional modules which may not come pre installed with python. Try to import the modules, if any weren't found, use the following commands.

`pip install logging` or `pip3 install logging`

`pip install threading` or `pip3 install threading`

`pip install futures` or `pip3 install futures`
