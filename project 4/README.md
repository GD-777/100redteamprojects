FTP Servers play a major role in building and running a website. An ill-configured ftp server can be easily exploited and a user can access files which he isn't supposed to.

These programs simulate FTP servers which are limitted to Local Area Network. An FTP server should always be running to serve the clients.

You will have to install an additional library

`pip3 install pyftpdlib`

Have Fun!
